DONE:
- [x] variable declaration
- [x] if statement
- [x] if-else statement
- [x] for statement
- [x] while statement
- [x] do-while statement
- [x] import statement
- [x] using statement
TODO:
- [ ] symbol
- [ ] type annotation




DONE:
- figure out how member_expression can takes to work in tree-sitter-js

the reason why js uses pattern for its parameter is that it has 
Destructuring assignments: function({ a, b }) or function([a, b])
which python and monkeyc doesn't have, so don't need to adapt pattern to parameter in monkeyc



TODO:
- learn more about scanner.c
